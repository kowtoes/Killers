                      <p class="style3">An interesting phenomenon in the world of serial killers is the circle created by the mutual influence of reality and fiction. Writers for television shows, movies, magazines and media in general frequently draw inspiration from real-life serial killers that have proven to stir immense fascination among American society. A perfect reflection of the influence of reality on fiction comes in the form of Dexter Morgan, the loveable vigilante serial killer. Jeff Lindsay’s 2004 Darkly Dreaming Dexter, a novel about a serial killer masquerading as a “normal” guy and working as a blood spatter expert for the Miami Police Department, influenced Showtime’s drama/comedy series of the same name in 2006.</p>
                      <p> But why copy Dexter?</p>
        <ul><li>America enjoys morally complex lead characters that challenge our notions of right and wrong</li>
        <li>Presents audiences with a clear reason for his madness: Dexter witnessed brutal murder of his mother and friends before he was adopted by his policeman father, explains his fascination with blood and his potential for psychosis</li>
        <ul>Moral code by which he dictates his own actions helps to establish a clear line between “acceptable” and “unacceptable” deviance ⇒ license to empower the voice within us all that cries out for brutal, bloody, visceral justice</li>
        </ul>

<p>Pardo [like Dexter Morgan] was a cop for the Miami Police Department. Also, Dexter Morgan has this ritual where he lays out the photos of bad guys he wants to kill on his computer. Manny Pardo, he would put up pictures of people he wanted to kill in his apartment, and, like Dexter, he would retain these “keepsakes.” While Dexter has his “blood slides,” Pardo would keep the ashes of the cartridges used to kill his victims in an urn, which represented the souls of his victims rotting in hell.</p>
<p>His victims were bad guys, mainly drug dealers, and he would keep also some trophies… He had a diary in which he would place articles about his murders and such. He also had keepsakes, so I think, you know, we have someone here who worked for the Miami Police Dept., kills “bad guys,” has a special ritual and this “Miguel Prado” name, well, it’s no coincidence. (Bourgoin interview, http://www.askmen.com/celebs/interview/stephane-bourgoin-interview.html)</p>
<p>Furthermore, Dexter creator Jeff Lindsay lived in Miami during the time of the Pardo case. Although Lindsay would never cite Pardo as a source of inspiration for his character, the creators of the Showtime series pay homage to Pardo with the Miguel Prado character, from the third season. </p>

<li>2008: Mark Twitchell lured two men to his movie studio, where he intended to film a Dexter-esque movie. Twitchell actually murdered one of them in filming the serial killer film, with the other managing to escape. Twitchell is actively trying to resurrect his film from his current location behind bars.</li>
<p></p><li>2009: Andrew Conleu “felt like Dexter” as he strangled his ten-year-old brother. After the murder he mimicked Dexter’s post-killing ritual by placing his brother’s head in plastic. This was all inspired by an urge to know what it feels like to kill.</li>
<p></p><li>2012: Mark Howe slashed his mother 53 times with a knife, leaving her to bleed out. Howe was yet another Dexter-obsessed fan, who confided in a friend that he wished he was Dexter. The murder was premeditated and backed by internet searches for “Dexter’s kill knife” and “What does a sociopath need to do to blend seamlessly with society?”</li>
<p></p><li>2014: Steven Miles, a 17 year-old teen from the UK was convicted for murdering his girlfriend. Miles had been diagnosed with Autistic Spectrum Disorder and was obsessed with Dexter. Weeks before the murder, Miles told the victim that she would see “similarities between the personality of Dexter and myself”.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Donnelly, Dexter is one of, if not the, most lovable antihero in film, because of his originality as a moral serial killer. The popularity of the show has grown so vast as to sell Dexter “souvenirs,” blood splattered household items along with body part jewelry. These gruesome items are bought and sold by fans of the show, who idolize the concept of a “good” serial killer. This is in stark contrast to many of the popular police shows on today, such as Law and Order, that emphasize justice as an extension of the law. Although it is undoubtable that Dexter brings a form of justice as well; he brings a distinctly American form of vigilante justice: killing the killers. Because of this, Dexter is unlike many of the antiheroes seen in modern television; he is better compared to Batman, because his vigilante methods are used solely for moral purposes.</p>
<p>The author describes this as “American Adam,” defining this as:</p>
<p><i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“a fully realized, independent individual, embodying the Romantic ideal of no concessions to the demands of a conforming civilization and yet… furthering its progressive imperatives” (Donnelly).</i></p>
